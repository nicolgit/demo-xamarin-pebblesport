#Demo Xamarin PebbleSport integration app
If you are looking for a xamarin Android sample that show how to manage the Pebble Sport app from a Xamarin Project, This repository is for you:-)

Because I haven't found out there any sample that shows to use Pebble SDK from Xamarin, I decided to write this one.

In order to use latest Pebble aar libary available, go to: https://oss.sonatype.org and look for "**com.getpebble**". Download the aar file and use it in a xamarin binding library as shown here.
